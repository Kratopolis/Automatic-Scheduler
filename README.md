# Automatic-Scheduler
Set of scripts that schedules employees for shifts throughout the week based on availability, shift times, and shift necessities

** Run schedule_master.py to run project**

This script is a small project that I decided to complete during December 2021
This is not work for my classes or major, just something that I decided to do

Skills improved:
  * Working with multiple classes interacting with each other
  * Practicing with master classes
  * Using datetime library and using it to grab future dates
  * Displaying and formatting useful information accurately into The console
  * Writing comments and describing my code as I go
  * Using sqlite databases to create tables to store information
  * Grabbing information from tables
  * Looping and checking multiple points of data
  
Possible flaws:
  * Does not take full advantage of data tables
  * Could be a little more user interactive
  * Could utilize another script to further abstract creation of data tables
  * Might not be fully optimized for searching through employee data
  * More features could be implemented such as accounting for days off or different shift times for different days
